=========================

1. There is no rush to push. We only support production tested capability. Better yet, peform code verification and unit testing.

2. Always run the full regression test suite. No exceptions.

3. Peer review when fully appropriate (ask for a pull request).

4. If adding a new feature, include a regression test for this feature. Refer to the section of this documentation on adding a test :ref:`here <add-test>`.
