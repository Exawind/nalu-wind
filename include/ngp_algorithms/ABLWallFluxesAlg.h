/** Simultaneously compute the wall shear stress and heat flux/surface
 *  temperature.  This boundary condition follows the algorithms outlined
 *  in
 *
 *     Basu, S., Holtslag, A. A. M., Bas, J. H., Van de Wiel, B. J. H., 
 *     Moene, A. F., and Steeneveld, G.-J., An Inconvenient "Truth" About
 *     Using Sensible Heat Flux As A Surface Boundary Condition in Models.

 *
 *  The velocity and temperature are sampled at the nodes opposing the
 *  wall nodes with the option for some type of averaging.  Then those
 *  values are used in the Monin-Obukhov similarity laws to compute
 *  friction velocity and heat flux.  Friction velocity is then used to
 *  compute wall shear stress with directionality related to the opposing
 *  node velocity vector.  Wall shear stress and heat flux can then be
 *  made locally fluctuating.
 * 
 *  An example from the input file is:
 *
 *```
 *    - wall_boundary_condition: bc_lower
 *      target_name: lower
 *       wall_user_data:
 *         velocity: [0.0,0.0,0.0]
 *         abl_wall_function:
 *           surface_heating_table:
 *             - [     0.0, 0.00, 300.0, 1.0]
 *             - [999999.9, 0.00, 300.0, 1.0]
 *           reference_temperature: 300.0
