/** Class for an Actuator Disk
 *
 *  This class creates an actuator disk by sampling the flow field
 *  with an OpenFAST Actuator line model.  As a result it inherits the
 *  majority of its functionality from the ActuatorFAST class.
 *
 *  The procedure for the disk is:
 *
 *  1) After the actuator line data structures are created additional
 *     points are added in between the lines at each discrete radial location.
 *     The points are inserted with a periodic Bezier curve (Sanchez-Reyes,
 * 2009) which is a parametric curve over the interval t \in [0, 2pi]. Since
 * these points are in-between the actuator lines they are refered to as 'swept
 * points' throughout the code.
 *
 *     The Bezier function can capture the coning affects, and if desired (not
 * implemented now) distortion of the disk due to blade motion.  Currently the
 * point positions for the disk and lines are never updated.
 *
 *  2) During a run the actuator line proceeds as normal, but prior to forces
 * being sent back to nalu-wind the force is averaged between the blades at each
 * discrete radial location.  This average value is then spread evenly across
 * all the points at the given radius (swept and line points), and this is the
 * force that is sent back to nalu-wind at all the discrete points.
