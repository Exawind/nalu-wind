Neutral Atmospheric Boundary Layer Case

30 Nov 2017

This case is an example for running a large-eddy simulation of a neutral-
stability atmospheric boundary layer using a no-slip wall stress implementation
outlined in the 2010 paper by Jaegle et al, "Implementation Methods of Wall Functions in Cell-vertex Numerical Solvers"

The rest of the setup matches the ablNeutralEdge regression test.

- To build the mesh, use NaluWindUtils abl_mesh with nalu_abl_mesh.yaml
- To initialze the fiels, use NaluWindUtils nalu_preprocess with 
  nalu_preprocess.yaml

Domain: 
  - x: 0 m - 5000 m
  - y: 0 m - 5000 m
  - z: 0 m - 1000 m
  - periodic laterally

Winds:
  - specified 8 m/s from 245 degrees (southwest) enforced with a
    P-controlled driving source term.

Initial temperature profile:
  - 300 K constant to 650 m
  - linear varying 300 K - 308 K from 650 m - 750 m
  - linear increasing at a rate of 3 K per 1000 m above 750 m

Initial velocity:
  - Constant 8 m/s from 245 degrees throughout with sinusoidal
    perturbations near the surface

Surface:
  - Rough wall shear stress model based on Monin-Obukhov similarity.
  - z0 = 0.2 m
  - qWall = 0 W/m^2

Upper Boundary:
  - Symmetry for momentum (effectively a no-stress lid).
  - Heat flux to maintain a specified temperature gradient

Coriolis:
  - Coriolis terms to account for Earth's rotation at 45 degrees
    north latitude

Bouyancy:
  - Density is set to constant
  - Boussinesq bouyancy in z-momentum 

SGS model:
  - one-equation subgrid-scale turbulent kinetic energy with 
    buoyancy source term.  Model constants are set to work well
    with ABL applications.

Other:
  - Reference pressure: 101325 Pa
  - Reference temperature: 300 K
  - Reference density: 1.178037 kg/m^3 (ideal gas based on 
    reference pressure gives this rho_ref = p_ref/((R/mw)*T_ref)
  - Viscosity: 1.2E-5 kg/m-s
